Advanced Health Prediction System This project is an Advanced Health Prediction System developed using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of two critical diseases: heart disease and diabetes. Built with Python, Flask, MongoDB, and React, the system processes patient data, including demographic information, medical history, and clinical measurements, to provide accurate disease predictions. Key features include prediction history, user authentication, and a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals. The system aims to improve early diagnosis, enhance healthcare delivery, and reduce the burden of these chronic diseases.
Key Features: Heart disease and diabetes prediction based on user input. Secure user authentication and management. History tracking of past predictions. Scalable and secure data handling. Integration with healthcare systems. Technologies Used: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) Flask (Backend) MongoDB (Database) React (Frontend) Bcrypt (Security)
